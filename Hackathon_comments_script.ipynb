The people who don’t use transit do not want to “subsidize” those who do. But transit investment is critical for growth of the whole region. We all know that single passenger-car commute, or even the ride-sharing economy, is ultimately unsustainable, not just in terms of cost, but in terms of congestion. And it is certainly subsidized, just like transit. <br/><br/>Commuters know this implicitly. Drivers know it but don’t like to admit it. We all know it. <br/><br/>We need to make transit a priority at the next election cycle.

I'm usually getting on the train around 10:00 am or some time in the afternoon going back and forth to work related appointments. When I moved here in 2001 the trip to Times Square was 15 - 20 minutes. Now it takes anywhere from 45 minutes to one hour and 15 minutes due to some sort of \"maintenance\" where they shut down the train in one direction 4 out of 5 days per week in the middle of a weekday. This is not a temporary project, they have been doing this for about 5 or so years. When this \"maintenance\" is in effect the number of trains running to and from Astoria in the middle of the weekday are cut by more then HALF. This coming July they will be closing my station completely in BOTH directions for 8 MONTHS to \"upgrade\" while still doing \"maintenance\" on the tracks 4 out of 5 weekdays in the middle of the day. So I'm looking forward to another 20 or so minutes added to my trip while I walk or take a bus to a nearby open station. Clearly the people who are in charge of the MTA don't take the subway.

This is considering some of the standards we hold women to are still the same standards as the ones our mothers, aunts, and grandmothers faced. But why do women have to always be what other people want us to be? (Whether it be happy, pleasant, quiet, obedient, etc.) I think this artwork is trying to portray that. Women are expected to smile and be happy and be pleasant to be around and look at, but that is not our purpose. Smiling, while it might seem like a simple gesture, is more than just a smile. It's a symbol for what society expects when a women comes around, its a symbol for what they think we should be doing. The fact is we are not made to be something nice to look at, we were created to be a part of something more than what the world allows us to be. Women don't need to always smile.

Therefore women also had to look pretty. The easiest way to appear \"pretty\" in modern society is to be happy. The definition of happiness changes depending on who is being asked, but usually, happiness is associated with smiles. Smiles are a symbolic way of showing that someone is feeling comfortable with their surroundings. Before, women had to look as though they were always happy with their surroundings. Their appearance did matter, but their opinions did not. While our society has been able to make some progress with women's rights, the stigma remains. We, as women, should smile and by default, be happy. I am the type of person who doesn't smile unless I genuinely mean it. This causes many people to make remarks saying \"smile, it makes you look prettier.\" These are the moments that show just how shallow we can be. This movement is empowering, as there is no need to tell anyone to smile. We should be grateful if we witness someone smiling at us, as that shows genuine feelings. Rather than forcing us to smile, our society should focus on more important things. There is too much going on in this world for people to focus on whether or not I, or any woman, smile. Smiling may be considered pretty, but there is nothing more attractive than someone who can speak their mind and show how they feel.\n",

And yet, one of my main complaints was that there was a hippy trail trampeled by travellers (we hated the word tourists) and guided by blue Lonely Planet bibles. Every time I wandered into a new place, Sultanahmet, Paris, London, Prague...I was greeted by the same faces. I ran into the same Australians and East Germans from Mexico City to Victoria, BC. And the conversations were always the same: \"where did you come from, how long were you there, did you see such and such.\"<br/><br/>We lived in our own Roam-like bubble, living the dream of banana pancake breakfasts by the beach. But we weren't professionals. There was no networking, copywriting, software engineering. That was for squares. We lived in relative squalor, and found work in day-labor construction, dishwashing, waiting tables, pumping gas, or a the lucky ones staffed the hostel for a while, saving up enough money to fund more travel.<br/><br/>It was great and it was also exhausting and weird. But it was a lot like you described in terms of not delivering on the promise of a care-free adventure. Everything finds a way of becoming a grind I guess. But good for you! You wrote a great piece and I sure as heck wasn't freelancing for the New York Times when I was 25. \n",

First off, if I were to win a lottery, I would likely become a target for scammers wanting a chunk of the prize that I won. The IRS would probably also give me some financial headaches. By winning the lottery, I believe the cons outweigh the positives depending on someone's economic situation. In my opinion, other than a person in deep poverty or in crippling debt, winning the lottery won't be too helpful once some time goes by. There is the whole world out there to explore where you can find meaning and happiness in life somewhere. In my opinion, while money something great to have around, I would rather try finding happiness and living a life where I'm happy with the things that I have done. \n",

Meanwhile poor or lower class neighborhoods tend to have larger, more aggressive dog breeds, such as the pit bull. These dogs are most likely used for protection.

I see everything from huge dogs “walking their owners,” to tiny dogs being rolled around in a stroller. I have three dogs, all different breeds, and all with a name that symbolizes something. My brothers and I take turns getting to name our dogs, and with our oldest dog, a chihuahua mix, it was my brother’s turn to choose, and he was only two, so he picked Captain Elizabeth, from Pirates of the Caribbean. Being that my family are huge N.C. State fans, we named our next dog after Carter Finley Stadium, his name is Finley. Our last dog, a dachshund  is named Annabel Lee after the Edgar Allen Poe poem.

This is telling me that this neighborhood is very active, people here are all for a \"healthy lifestyle\", and I could have probably guessed that many of them have kids (labradors and golden retrievers are great babysitters). However, if you go downtown you see more small breeds like Yorkshire terrier and Chihuahua. this is because the area is smaller, there are no backyards mostly, which means that a big dog won't have place to run, and the owners are probably very busy working.<br/>I know this sounds really stereotypical, but all stereotypes come from somewhere. \n",

I think that those facts colored a lot of critics perception and, by extension, reviews of the movie. As someone who went into the film with the same thoughts, I'll say this: Hugh Jackman and the cast elevated the material. They are having a blast and you can feel their love coming through every frame and every note. On a fundamental level, this movie speaks to us as human beings. About hope in seemingly impossible dreams, about being accepted when we've so often been reviled and rejected. About being loved despite our flaws or what society says is wrong with us. This movie slaps cynicism in the face (and let's be honest, for critics cynicism seems to their default setting at times) and practically begs you to try and bring down their joy. That was the feeling in my theatre as the credits rolled: joy. The teenage girls behind me were unabashedly thrilled and delighted with the movie. Their joy was palpable and contagious. As I walked out of the theatre, I heard one couple saying they wanted to see it again. The Greatest Showman may not be a perfect movie, it is about a very flawed man, but it gives it's audience something that is sorely missing in our world right now: hope and joy and love and acceptance.  Much like P.T., many of us have million impossible dreams that are keeping us awake- watching his come true may give some of us the courage to keep dreaming. \n",

First, it's about a circus--and circuses have always offered the masses a much-needed break from reality. There is also a happy ending for everyone (even the cynical critic character hints he has had a change of heart about what P.T. Barnum has done).  Yes, it's hokey, but you leave the theater with a light heart and a smile on your face--a rarity these days. The audience has gone so far as to applaud after 5 of the 8 viewings.  Other than on opening night for \"event\" movies, when does that happen?  People suspend reality when they see the film and feel happier when they leave the theater than when they entered.

Then there is the “Charge Master” (CM) which the providers use to bill.  This is a black-box that you don’t get to see inside and while your insurance company has a set of Reasonable-and-Customary payments along with contracts with medical providers to accept their R&amp;C’s instead of the CM rates. Many medical care consumers know that the CM can be, and often is, up to 10 times what the R&amp;C’s will pay. No, it isn’t simple and it has to be addressed.

(Don't forget that those same Americans are still on the hook for that $3,095 at the end of the day.) <br/><br/>No doubt that Ryan's average American's $1.50 per week will most certainly be cycled back into the economy, but the massive corporate windfall will wind up sitting alongside the mountains of cash that corporations (and the uber-wealthy) are already sitting on. Those mountains of cash are never likely to be recycled back through our economy as they would be if they had been directed to the lower and middle economic class, providing them with disposable income.<br/><br/>Next, Ryan, et al, will be taking aim at social programs like Medicare, Social Security, and infrastructure, the very things that allow average Americans to keep their noses above water, claiming that we cannot afford them.\n",

And make no mistake: it is political pornography that has brought our nation to this awful place, not the sexual variety.  <br/><br/>While we may have had a porn star run for Governor in California a while back, the fact is that it was only a steady diet of mind-warping political pornography, like that dished up daily on FOX News and conservative talk radio, that could have led to the election of a multi-faceted degenerate like Donald Trump.  Moreover, while sexual pornography tends to only hold most people's attention through their first physical climax, FOX News and conservative radio is apparently so unhealthily compelling for its viewers and listeners that they refuse to change the channel - even as it rots their soul and poisons our country.\n",

I hid it under a loose floor tile.  But by today’s standards she was more covered than women sitting around the pool in a retirement home ad.  Attitudes change over time, and no time has been so transformed by the Internet.<br/><br/>Mr. Douthat thinks that restricting the production or viewing of porn in the Internet age is desirable, even if it were possible, which it probably isn’t.  Ax-wielding types like Carrie Nation thought they could stamp out the evils of alcohol through prohibition, but all it did was drive it underground and create a hidden economy.<br/><br/>While some sorts of limits on abuse or coercion are necessary, hearing Mr. Douthat long for creating “better men” through censorship has a 1984 ring to it.  He has also frequently attributed many of society’s ills to the sexual revolution of the 1960s, lamenting our reduced fecundity which is clearly against God’s will.  He’d also rather that Catholics stay in loveless or abusive marriages rather than remarry, and opposes abortion, even if the woman can’t take care of the child.<br/><br/>Porn is probably going to be with us forever.

His very pale white mother was a devout Catholic and wanted to send him to parochial school.  (His older sister who could kind of pass was already in a girls parish school.)  None of the Brooklyn boys elementary schools would take him because of his race.  His mother somehow got an audience with the bishop.  She is said to have told the bishop that she was a good Catholic and she wanted to raise her son as one so she needed him to be in Catholic school.  And the bishop arranged for him to attend St. Paul's. QED.<br/><br/>That little boy became my husband many years after he came to work for this white woman as a staff accountant at a large firm.  He kept up through his life with the friends he had made in grade school and the wider Brooklyn neighborhood he moved in while growing up.  The crowd at his wake last year on Fourth Avenue was such as mix up of skin colors as is still seldom seen.  But I remember when he was first working for me in 1976.  It was in midtown. We had left work about 6pm and both wanted to catch the bus. It was coming and we were running for it, him behind me.  I suddenly realized that I had to stop running.  The picture we presented was not safe for him.  That has not changed for black men no matter the skin color of their parents.\n",

Today, roughly 7 in 10 teachers assign homework that requires the internet, and a survey from the Hispanic Heritage foundation found that nearly 50 percent of students surveyed said they were unable to complete a homework assignment because they didn't have access to the internet or a computer.  Pew research indicates that 5 million US households with school-age children do not have broadband internet access at home, either because service is not available (as is the case in many rural areas) or because they can't afford it.

There is an insistence on a \"quick fix\" in medicine, which is why people demand antibiotics for viral infections in spite their doctor's advice not to take them.  Stents in stable angina are like that, except with more complications..potentially lethal.  People in this country have got to learn that immortality is not possible and that human disease and the methods to treat disease are not straightforward.  <br/><br/>In my practice as a nephrologist, dialysis in the very elderly is an analogous issue.  In spite of good studies concluding that medical management at a certain level of kidney function is just good as starting them on dialysis, there is a significant minority of patients (or rather their families) who demand dialysis in spite of the evidence explained to them by me.  We have to stop believing that medical procedures will provide an instant cure.  This societal defect in this country is a key factor behind what is driving up the cost of care.\n",

Consider this fact concerning the 2009 ban: This was the first case of doping based on circumstantial evidence alone; no forbidden substances were ever found during her repeated tests. And how about this: On 15 March 2010, Gerhard Ehninger, head of the German Society for Hematology and Oncology, said that an evaluation of the case points to a light form of a blood anemia called spherocytosis – apparently inherited from her father.

Upon finding out what we would be expected to pay, as his parents, to put him where he wanted to be, I put my foot down.  As a public school teacher, I simply did not have, nor would I ever have, that sort of money.  In the end, he went to an in-state school a full day's drive from home and never looked back.  He became well-known on campus (for good reasons), found work he enjoyed with the university, earned numerous accolades and scholarships, and thoroughly enjoyed himself.  Not that he ever admitted it to me.  Two years later, he applied to one of the nation's most prestigious law schools and was admitted immediately.  He related his embarrassment when well-known attorneys asked him where he went to undergraduate school, while his peers were all from the most elite of schools.  Little did he realize that his background set him apart in the best of ways, as it made his interviewers want to know more about him, looking at him with considered appreciation.  To this day, he continues to thrive, and to be appreciated in his work.  Going to school in-state was a blessing rather than a bane for him. Life would be great if he didn't owe a quarter of a million dollars for those three years of graduate school....  \n",

Most gay Chinese aren’t even out, and will unhappily marry out of a filial duty. Lucky lesbians and gay men find each other and enter into sham marriages together.

After duly setting it with the \"Why Do I Love You?\" words, on a lark he turned his paper over and wrote out an alternate set of lyrics which he knew Kern would hate. Kern had an aversion to lyrics that mentioned CUPID, considering such lyrics too trite and out-of-date to be taken seriously. Here's how the fake lyrics began:<br/><br/>CUPID knows the way:<br/>He's a naked boy,<br/>Who can make you sway<br/>To love's own joy.<br/>When he shoots his little arrow,<br/>He can thrill you to the marrow...<br/><br/>Hammerstein presented them as the actual finished lyrics.

It took me 6.5 years. I also already bought my own very nice house with my husband and we live really well and make, combined, about $250k. My husband's student loans are also paid off. Our credit scores are excellent and we pay everything on time, have established 401ks and savings. We just got into our 30s. We are from lower middle class families where none of our parents went to college.<br/><br/>Overall the student loan repayment wasn't so bad, because it was all actually worth it.

Degrees in women's studies, English lit, history, psychology... why are you paying for that? I also know students who took out far more student loan than they needed just so they could live really nice, go to restaurants multiple times a week, etc. Now they are paying for it.<br/><br/>My advice for people getting student loans: only take as much as you absolutely need.

Like everyone else, I want to fully enjoy the college experience. And after attending a few college tours, I was able to understand what some may have meant about falling in love with a college. However, with enough effort, in such diverse environments, each individual should be able to find their own niche. Just by not attending your supposed dream school does not mean that you will be dooming yourself to years of misery. And even so, I don’t think the experience of four years is worth a lifetime of being chased by debt.<br/>Others may argue that perhaps the pricier school, the higher ranked one, would offer you a better education that could lead to a future job with a higher salary. You could easily pay off the debt  while living a fulfilling life. But as Prolux had mentioned, living with debt can be suffocating. Many enter the college process, underestimating just how the amount can bloat over time, and constantly weigh upon you - decades past graduation. A fancy diploma does not guarantee a high paying job.

The “soul-crushing” debt doesn’t completely weigh into people’s minds when they start their higher education, but it gives them extreme anxiety every time they have to think about the education’s price tag. <br/><br/>Starting when we’re young, it’s cemented into our minds that college is ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL to succeed in life. Alright, that’s cool, but how are we supposed to pay off our debt once we’ve graduated? How is EVERYONE supposed to know how to manage the debt and come up with a way to diminish it? How is everyone supposed to face the harsh realities of college?<br/><br/>Overall, I do believe that student debt is worth it, but I believe that people need to have a plan on how to pay off the debt.

This used to be called Home Economics: now I suppose it’s Life Skills.<br/><br/>I lived in a poor, urban neighborhood for years while I was in school.

Ranked-Choice/Instant Runoff voting is the way to reform the old 2-party polarized system and prevent militant minorities (who are Republicans these days) to win with a mere plurality, thereby thwarting the will of the voters. The way it should work is if no candidate in a race of 3 or more candidates wins at least 50% plus one vote, there is a runoff between the top two vote-getters. A variant is voters get to rank their choices instead of voting for only one candidate. This way, if a voter's first choice finishes \"out of the money\" so to speak--that is not first or second, they are eliminated from the race and the second choice candidate gets the vote. If second choice is not one of the top two vote getters, then third choice gets the vote, and so on.

Speaking for myself, Cunanan's horrible crimes were a complete mystery until this masterful performance which I find illuminates the real monster behind the inexplicable crimes and does it without cleaning him up. In Episode 2, Cunanan boasts that he's done nothing with his life and, by implication, gotten away with doing nothing which for him has been an accomplishment because he's very lazy, but obviously craves what BIG money can buy. I found that key to what set off the killings. He's in his late 20's and life as an A-list boy toy is winding down. He'll have a paunch before too long and wealthy old men will turn elsewhere for entertainment. Obviously, Cunanan hated the wealthy old men he serviced as a gigolo and hated the younger men he desired who didn't want him and, feeling time slip away, started retaliating against life by murdering those he resented which he found to be a drug more powerful than anything he'd ever experienced. Eventually, he murders Versace, the genius artist, who he's more jealous of than anyone. I love the fact that the story is told in reverse.

At first glance, the image portrays the fact that humans tend to deal with problems by covering them up, therefore not actually fixing the issue. The more I gazed at the image, I also noticed that the thin bandage only wraps around part of the word. This could be interpreted as only fixing or addressing part of a problem. The uncovered part of the problem is left unsolved. This image reminds me of the recent shooting that occurred in Florida this past week. To call the increasing number of school shootings in America, a problem, is a huge understatement. It is a nightmare that does not end for families all over the country and that our government is struggling to find a solution to. It is as if our country has a broken bone and we are trying to heal by putting a band-aid on it. We might be covering the surface of the wound but the problem still exists beneath the surface.

However, the media can - and SHOULD - help us to understand the information we receive so that we can decide (i) first, how reliable it is, and (ii) whether and how to act on it. This is essential to fight against the 'fake news' onslaught by the purveyors of truly fake news (apologies for the oxymoron).

            "Olympic competitors have been finding technology to improve their speed and win for their country. In the end the human race has reached its final plateau (little to no change) period. There is always going to be a new record of something regardless of what it is because that is just how us humans act. We love to beat records and show people up ever by the fewest of seconds. The Russian skater Debis Yuskov broke the nearly decade-old 1,500-meter record, shaving off 0.02 seconds of the original time. He most likely did this by using technology. This is my opinion, but all the technology takes away from the actual person of how they’re able to race. It’s not all the competitor’s physical abilities. They’re enhanced with multi-fabric bodysuits. These bodysuits were introduced in 2002 to reduces drag by more than half a second in the competitors’ races. This takes away from the enjoyment to watch the speedskating, fans and athletes do not like the fact that technology is taking center stages over athletes.\tIn conclusion, I do think that humans have reached their peak of improvement of physical abilities to beat world records. As well as using technology to help enhance they’re natural abilities just to beat world records.\n",

Humans can only get so fast, and so strong. The reality is that the better we get, the fewer accomplishments we will make. That isn't the question we should be dwelling on. The important question this article raises is whether or not we should be using technology to enhance our performances in sports, and if so, to what extent we should be doing that. My answer to this whole question is a resounding “What does it matter?” In my ideal world, we would keep sports as a friendly competition, just something to better each other. But this isn’t my ideal world- in fact, it’s far from it. Enhancements in the Olympics, and in sports as a whole are completely, 100% unavoidable. Despite what I want to believe, there’s always someone who's going to have some sort of unnatural advantage; because from steroids to deflated footballs - SOMEONE is always going to be cheating. So is this really a question that requires much thought? Not at all. Anyone who doesn’t live under a rock understands that technological interference in sports kind of defeats the purpose - especially with the Olympics, where athletes have to train for years. The unfortunate thing is that it’s inevitable because, in this world, things are only becoming more connected, and more computerized. Sports are no exception.\n",

These changes are a result of new technologies and advancements without a doubt, although humans have also changed, they have become faster, stronger and taller. It states that the average height of adults has increased throughout the 20th century, this is an advantage and i believe this and advancements in new technologies play a huge role in how sports have changed.<br/>Technology is the future of sport i believe, from the past to the present there has been new equipment and tools that have enhanced sports and the way we see them. For example, the multi-fabric body suit from 2002 reduced drag by more than half a second, this was a huge advancement in speed skating, to think the future of body suits could involve 3D printing is incredible to me.<br/><br/>I think people should also understand that technology will never stop evolving in sports, For example, newer models are made every year with the latest and greatest from that company, these innovations could make the difference.<br/> This topic on technology and sports reminded me of FIFA and their 'goal line technology' in soccer, its used to decide if a goal was called correctly or not, this helped the referees and reduced controversy making the game more fair.<br/>Athletes should use technology to improve their performance, i think incorporating it into their training could lead to more plateaus in sports competition.\n",

During WWII, the Buddhists sided with the Japanese and would invade the Hill People's villages, rape the women and girls and emasculate the men and boys before they burned the villages.  Baming  the Rohingya is just like blaming the Jews for Hitler's genocide.  The Buddhists call the Rohingya \"terrorists\" as justification for their ethnic cleansing. \n",

The promise is breathtaking.<br/>But I also worry that growing interest in genomics and the resultant \"precision medicine\" will distract us from the deplorable status of so many Americans, millions of whom, do not even have health care coverage. As a result we are failing to treat widely prevalent diseases like hypertension and diabetes, which have a clear impact on our public health and downstream costs due to complications and mortality that result from this societal neglect.<br/>So often, the conversation is framed as an either or proposition.

It is a self-reinforcing process that, while incredibly exciting, is also much more expensive.<br/><br/>Our government needs to recognize the importance of greater funding such research.

However, he faces an almost unsolvable economic problem in the short term (i.e. in the next 20 years) and medium term (i.e in the next 60 years or so).  Given the extreme poverty found in most black communities in South Africa, even a well running, corruption-free government would have a hard time, solely through economic growth (typically, in the low single digits), providing tangible economic benefits to its poor citizens in anything less than many, many, many generations (perhaps 100 years or more).  As one recent example, China -<br/> which has had tremendous sustained growth over the last 40 years - still has many hundreds of millions of its population that live in dire poverty.  Reducing poverty could be sped up by a transfer of significant wealth from the white minority to the black majority but you run the risk of white flight and economic collapse as happened in Zimbabwe, which admittedly implemented an extreme program of wealth transfer.<br/>The unfortunate reality is that patience over the next three or four generations will be required but I not sure that this is politically realistic.\n",

It is possible, if he works closely with business and creates the right climate for businesses to grow. Whether that involves tax cuts or reducing regulations or both remains to be seen. Personally I think they should raise VAT to beef up the coffers a bit and then cut corporate and SME taxes to stimulate spending.  When things start to improve a bit, they can always cut VAT.

Cosmopolitanism is an very old ethical idea with roots in classical antiquity.  Its modern incarnation has been explored by philosophers like Martha Nussbaum and Kwame Anthony Appiah.  And while Mr. Brooks passes over this fact in silence, it is an approach to ethical life more common among liberals than conservatives.  Closing borders, building walls, and scapegoating immigrants, as Trump and the Republicans would have us do, amounts to a vehement rejection of cosmopolitanism.  The \"amphibians\" Brooks speaks of do not appear spontaneously; they emerge from a liberal culture of tolerance and accommodation, which nurtures the cosmopolitan spirit.  \n",

Many tried to help Mr. Cruz who has multiple problems and has suffered losses that still don't add up to shooting 17 of your classmates, even if some were bullies. What stands out is the lack of regulation on the sale of guns, especially to anyone under 25, the age at which the human brain is fully formed. Even those in the military or police are highly supervised, and their weapons can be taken away if they appear erratic. No other country not at war experiences the level of murder that occurs in the U.S. No other country blithely sells guns online, or sees instruments of murder as a taxable profit-making venture. Would we sell Fentanyl this way? Yes, criminals will still be able to get illegal guns, but there would be many fewer murders and mass murders happening if it were illegal to purchase guns for most of the population or at least, for anyone under 25.

Then, in 1970, a recession described as stagflation arrived almost to the day when I graduated. Jobs were suddenly hard to get; then the Seven Sisters of Oil (the world's biggest oil companies), colluding with the oil-soaked middle eastern kingdoms and autocracies, brought us the oil embargo with long lines as the gas pumps and higher prices for gasoline. <br/><br/>And for the first time in my native Los Angeles, real estate prices and development went on a building/buying/selling rampage. Tax assessors were caught off guard along with retirees who saw their property taxes jump five fold and more. It has been a rollercoaster ever since. This was my first introduction to economic theory; not the numbers with pie charts and graphs; we're talking behavioral economics. <br/><br/>When President Carter was sent packing by a slick-talking, blathering B-movie actor, Ronald Reagan, his first budget director, David Stockman, advised Reagan not to adopt the new \"trickle-down\" economic theory of economist Arthur Laffer; Stockman warned of a major recession by the end of the 1980s. Stockman was right. <br/><br/>And so, everything conservatives have touched since 1981, economics, healthcare, education, banking, manufacturing, ... it has always created a mess. Democrats clean it up; the GOPs make another mess. Repeat. The cycle continues. \n",

A stronger dollar, good, right? Strength is good! Not so in in a global economy built on a single national currency, the US dollar. <br/><br/>This points to the dangers of Trump's myopic focus on trade. His willingness to use tariffs to punish efficient competitors looks past its other effects: higher consumer prices, reduced exports, and shifts by producers to other markets that take advantage of better pricing.<br/><br/>Trump has no grasp of debt, how it works, how it ties America to a global economy, how it is impossible to separate America from these ties. Conversely, he has no sense of how to make them work! Europe is recovering strongly; Kansas, the conservative model, is collapsing. Flint is still drinking poison. Trump has no solutions. The tax cuts make good sound bites. But they lack substance. Working families paid for them with their healthcare. <br/><br/>You can't privatize pot holes when China is rolling out a 65 country infrastructure project, set to capture global economic trends. Fights over trade don't open new markets! Trump's policies show the difference between understanding the contradictions at the heart of economic policy and the confusion that reigns when these contradictions are blithely ignored.\n",

It's not mental illness, it's not good guys with guns, it's the fact that guns are seeping out of every nook and cranny of our society and it is that available which allows these people to commit mass murder. <br/><br/>The arguments put forth by my conservative colleagues simply doesn't hold water.

Second, is the term \"militia\", defined as \"a military force that is raised from the civil population to supplement a regular army\". We have such a force already. It is called the National Guard. So, a proper interpretation of the opening clause of the 2nd Amendment would be that you have to be in the Guard (militia) to qualify for the rest of the amendment.

But if such state tyranny is really the problem, then they should be marching alongside Black Lives Matter protesters demonstrating against police shootings while calling for poor black neighborhoods to arm themselves.  Obviously these Wayne La Pierre acolytes do not object to that kind of tyranny.<br/><br/>Mass shootings rivet national attention.  But of the 30,000 gun deaths each year in the U.S., most are suicides, and most of the rest are young black men being gunned down near their homes.

I'm sick, especially, of Trump, of Ryan, of McConnell, of the NRA, of the GOP, and frankly, of all the \"nice\" white people (and I'm white) who refuse to see what's going on. <br/><br/>I don't want Trump, the GOP, and the NRA, just to be voted out of office.

My own politics were shaped in the Vietnam era; I am a progressive Democrat and, drawing on my family history, an unreconstructed, unrepentant New Dealer.  I believe that the federal government plays a critical role in democratic process, by acting as watchdog on the environment and financial community and working to ensure that all Americans are housed, clothed, fed and have health care.<br/><br/>After graduating from law school, I worked for several years at a large, hi-end law firm. For the first time, I met Republicans and conservatives. I agreed with them about nothing, but thought that they were reasonable, intelligent people, not villains. Many remain my good friends.  Not one voted for Trump.<br/><br/>The people to whom I am not listening are not my GOP friends; they are fundamentalist extremists, anti-government zealots, crackpots and - my family members who are Trumpsters - poorly educated, unworldly tribalists who’ve spent their entire lives in a segregated, suburban, ethnic blue-collar culture.  I am not listening to these people, because they are illogical, uninformed and prejudiced. They say nothing worth listening to; it’s FOX or Trump all the way.<br/><br/>When I hear smart arguments from informed people, I listen and debate.  When I hear Trump, I hit the mute button.

Ms. Hurd's pointed blame for those who have even less than she does is simply wrong - both factually and morally. <br/><br/>People on Medicaid aren't 'stealing' affordable health care from her, but people on Wall Street - and dependent on their annuities from Wall Street - most certainly are. <br/><br/>Health care is both better, as measured by quality of population health, in places that offer a public alternative to for-profit health care than the health of Americans, and far, far, far cheaper as a total cost distributed across a population.<br/><br/>If Ms. Hurd wanted to meaningfully and accurately focus her appropriate moral outrage, she would direct it with laser focus on the insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies that steal and bilk from all of us every day in pursuit of ever-higher dividends and ever-greater annual increases in the rate of growth of profit. <br/><br/>We know who the enemies of American families are, and it's sure not those with even less than we have. <br/><br/>If Americans want affordable, quality health care, they will STOP the economy until we have a government who will put citizens' needs above their cronies' profits. <br/><br/>That is all there is to it. \n",

I had that moment of truth -- that that's part of what a classroom should be, a place to learn and a place to exchange ideas safely.  There's a teacher there to stimulate discussion and to moderate debate.  There's a reason to go to that class where it's safe to learn new things.  I do not think that there's much more a teacher can do.  I had no closets in which to hide the students.  I probably wouldn't be too useful in applying tourniquets, which is what my former colleagues are being asked to learn how to do.  A short person, I doubt I could possibly keep a shooter at bay.  What is this that society is asking of teachers?  I did everything I could for my students, but take a bullet for them?  Why is the shooter in the hallway in the first place?  In requesting that teachers be the sheriffs, you're reducing schools to being the OK corral.  This is impossible.  We're already having trouble educating our students.

Allen was able to park his 1952 Dodge station wagon for three days in Manhattan for $4.95.<br/><br/>In the early 1960s, I was talking to a man who had become a sign painter during the early years of the Great Depression of the 1930s. One of his first signs was for a meat market that was having a special sale on hamburger: 3 pounds for 33 cents. He said that he remembered the price because he had a hard time getting each number 3 to look the same on the sign. I was shocked that hamburger could have been so inexpensive. And now I'm shocked again that Peter could park for 3 days in Manhattan for $4.95 in 1962.<br/><br/>One day all too soon, these will be the \"good old days.\" And, on a political note, we can really make these the good old days if we all vote in November! \n",

While not debating the description, it seems that they all behave this way because they can.  Big business Republican executives have toiled unceasingly behind the scenes for decades, since FDR infuriated them with his New Deal policies after the great depression, toward controlling all of the branches of government to arrive at the nearly end state we are experiencing today.  Their goal was never again to have to relinquish their robber baron status to the lower and middle classes of the US whose standards of living rose to new and unacceptable heights for a paltry few decades after WWII.  Well, they succeeded. They now openly manipulate the healthcare, the salaries, the retirement benefits, the policing, and the voting rights of more than 90% of US citizens through years of targeted legislation and repeal of legislation, court decisions, budget control, media control and manipulation, election influence through gerrymandering, and ownership of voting machines. etc.  In 2016 they even allowed a hostile foreign government to introduce money and electronic manipulation into the US election system solely for ultimate political and financial gain.  They have taken control of our national resources and our American lives and they have no intention to give up that control.  They don't need to show character, so they don't. \n",

This should enlist the support of all the insurance companies to pass the legislation and provide a similar level of risk assessment of each owner's ability to satisfy licensing requirements and level of responsibility as they provide for automobiles. Insurance cost would be rated on these factors such that the more dangerous weapons (like dangerous cars) would be more expensive and difficult to own. And, owning or operating an uninsured gun would carry a stiff penalty such that owners would have an incentive to get rid of them.

And what about a disposal that donates your body or as many of its parts possible for subsequent use by people and/or for research purposes? What do hospitals and research centers do with donated bodies and their parts that they no longer need? Do they bury, cremate or send them to garbage landfills?  I don’t mean to be cynical here. I just think what they do could suggest other avenues for people to consider for themselves. My gut is burials increasingly are going to be viewed as damaging to the environment, so much so that in a generation they will be prohibited except in rare cases.

How is it that communities that lived relatively peacefully for centuries turn against each-other all of a sudden?  I think a combination of competition for resources and elite ethnic entrepreneurs exploiting these sentiments  is tearing the nation state apart in many places in Africa and beyond.<br/>This issue is unraveling many countries in Africa.  Neighboring Ethiopia is on the verge of implosion.  South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, Cameroon...the list is long.  These countries are only countries on the map.  Societies are deeply divided.  Maybe it is time to rethink the borders inherited from colonialism.  But starting over with ethnicity as an organizing principle is equally daunting, if not more.  There has been over six decades of mixing and imagining oneself as Kenyan, Cameroonian and Sudanese etc.<br/>Secession has not helped South Sudan, it is again going through a debilitating civil war along ethnic lines.  There are very many questions and few answers.  Add to this the role of outsiders and corruption, it is a depressing scenario.   Much lip service to democracy but elections are invariably rigged as in Kenya.  It is a challenge to get people to vote outside their ethnicity, even if one agrees with the ideas of someone from another ethnic group.

            "I am a Republican, born and raised. I am also all for the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms, and I believe that the government should not have complete control over our guns. But after seeing school shootings like this over and over on the news, there comes a time when any rational person must think “Hmm, maybe we should try to do something about all these shootings.” What these students went through is absolutely heart breaking. I couldn’t imagine what some of the kids, exspecially the younger kids must have felt. This is something that will change their lives forever. And if we just choose to see the whole situation as it is, a terrible thing, and if we don’t look at the good that could possibly come from this, then nothing will change. This event, as horrible as it is, sparked a flame of inspiration inside the hearts of these students to go and make a difference and I believe this terrible act of violence does in fact have the potential to turn into something good. Ever since I was old enough to really start watching the news I’ve been seeing almost countless reports on shootings all around the country. Honestly, I found myself growing numb to them. But hearing all these story’s of the kids doing heroic things and all the students getting together for a great cause to help save lives and protect future generations has lit a spark in me to. I intend to help these students in any way possible to accomplish their goal of having stricter regulations on guns. \n",

I've always felt that I hear about school shootings far too often and it always makes me consider the reality that my school may be next. This is why I agree with many of the things Ms. Gonzalez said in her speech, especially the fact that the U.S has far more gun-related issues when compared to other countries. That all being said, this is an arguement about security versus freedom. Take away the guns and you gain security but lose some of your freedoms. Most people would argue that this is worth it because school shootings are an epidemic. However, this is simply not the case. The number of school shootings victims per year has been on a decline since the 90s. In the past 25 years, around 10 kids per year were killed in school shootings meaning that more kids die from drowning in pools and in biking accidents than they do from school shootings. In fact, four times the number of students were killed in schools in the early 90s than today. Now then, I am all for gun reform because any number of students dying per year is too much. But, lets not blow this out of proportion. School shootings seem like a bigger threat than they actually are due to media coverage allowing for news of such things to spread like wildfire. The reality of the situation is that there are more important issues in the world that we should be devoting our energy and time towards.\n",

These young people’s perspective come out different than older people because younger minds are known to not comprehend such strategies, like these ones, as older people do.  I believe if i were to be among this situation I would react and change my perspective on things differently than I do now just hearing in on the news or the radio. I believe there has been enough mass shootings for people to just sit and pray among them. People need to act out and do something about it because nothing is getting done only more and more people are getting killed by the second. I believe that our generation can have the power to overcome these strategies, but only if we do something about it! Stand up and take charge of these mishaps because it is not too early to take charge if anything it’s way too late. We should not let the people who died in these mass shootings die in vain. They died for a reason. They died because our society is corrupted and messed up and we need to stand up and make a change to it.\n",

There are huge amounts of empty space in the concourse serving  vendors (that appear under utilized). At the same time, the way the stairways were built, there is almost no room on the platforms, and it's impossible for entering and exiting passengers to move out of each others' way; at rush hour, people are almost falling off the A/C platforms for lack of anywhere to stand; the station is divided into zones, with doors that block passenger flow.  The doors at the entrance/exits of the complex are too heavy anyone but reasonably strong adults to open.   Elderly people or weaker/frailer people can't get in and out of the station by themselves.

The French team did not originate this style (though they execute it beautifully).

I also worry about the use of surgery and/or chemicals on teens who feel as though they are of the \"wrong\" sex. I know from my own experience that there were times in my (female) life when I felt very masculine and wondered what was wrong with me.  Looking at me pre-puberty, you would have thought I was a boy (not just from the way I dressed, but also my walk and mannerisms).  Then things changed and I went through a phase of feeling (and looking) very feminine and into \"girly\" things.  In my 30s it was back to feeling more masculine, then in 40s through where I am today, feminine again.  This all sounds odd, and I don't fully understand it myself.  But, I thank my lucky stars that no adult ever validated my gender confusion when I was young and vulnerable and suggested to me that surgery or chemicals could resolve things for me and turn me in to a man.  I love being a woman. <br/><br/>Because of my own experiences, I feel strongly that no one under the age of 18 should ever be allowed to change the sex of their bodies.  But, adults can do what they want, and it isn't going to harm me--and has nothing to do with me.  What the heck is the matter with Republicans that they are always trying to tell people how to be?

Unfortunately, some opinions lack evidence or logical reason, and while they may benefit the public for a short period of time, they could become damaging in the long run. Say a congressman/woman doesn’t believe in climate change. They promote their views by saying things like “those who believe in global warming are unAmerican treehuggers”. To some, this discredits whatever research the “treehuggers” may have had, and then it becomes harder for the public to agree on global warming. It becomes a personal debate; no side wants to admit they were wrong and listen to the other explain why. This is a recurring theme, and it doesn’t matter which party you belong to. Humans are stubborn beings.<br/><br/>But this doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s bad to form an opinion based on emotions, as this can keep compassion and morality in your thoughts when you’re thinking about other people.

While I think the review was not really negative, but rather thoughtful, I believe it missed an important point.<br/>I think the reviewer thought that by fitting several related stressful and important issues all together  the effect was to dilute the focus  on any one of them. However, what I found most powerful is by focussing on  all  together its effect on me was to show how possibly overwhelming it can be to the lives of people trying to deal with a number of significant stresses all at the same time. And, I think this play did just that - at the end, the the mix of all those stresses was overwhelming to this family, and, realistically, the overall issues were too overwhelming and therefore not neatly resolved. I.e., it did not have a resolved ending - and that’s life. I was fully engaged. It was continually stressful, as one issue led to another, and by the end, my first thinking was “no”!  Where is the neat release of audience stress? Well, that’s life. There is no neat resolution for this family.\n",

He has one duty in his eyes, to serve himself and people he recognizes as equally without conscience and on the take.<br/><br/>When he was in real trouble in the 90s, Putin saw the advantage of having his oligarchs buy into Trump's projects, with the purpose of using him as an \"asset\".

Were the foods we were eating back then as authentic as available now, no,  but the experiences had more to do with the cultures me and my brothers were exposed to and less so the food. We never really thought black people made the best fried chicken, Chinese the best dumplings or Italians the best pizza. We just enjoyed learning to use chop sticks as opposed to a knife and fork or sitting at a communal table in Georgia having a meat and three. Italian for us wan't the local pizzeria but it was when we went to Little Italy or South Philly. We never knew lamb chops were served anyway but well done until we ate at a French restaurant in Quebec. Sometimes I think Chef Chang was a bit harsh on those who thought a specific food like authentic pizza had to be made a certain way but I totally agree with his consensus that like that chef in Japan, you can make pizza or something else with the ingredients at hand and still call it pizza.

At the time it seemed appropriate to have a funeral service for him in a Buddha temple, so, accompanied by Mali, Harry’s erstwhile companion (also a Golden), my wife and I sat in a wat and witnessed as six Buddha priests in saffron robes sent Harry in his way with incense and solemn chants, which somehow eased our pain and sense of loss.<br/><br/>In the middle of the ceremony, as is required for such occasions, ‘an offering’ was required, so a large silver bowl heaped with freshly steamed rice was obtained and put beside Harry’s body. Mali observed. Then, after a minute, rising slowly to her feet from where she was laying between us, she slowly walked to the bowl and, with a thoughtful air perfectly suited to the occasion, methodically consumed all the rice. She then, unbidden, returned to her space between us and sat down. The priests didn’t bat a collective eye.<br/>At the end of the service Harry was carried out on a bier and buried beside the wat. When we returned the next week to put flowers on the grave, Mali lay on the burial mound.<br/><br/>Mali completed her own journey years later and now rests beneath the yellow plum tree outside our window, on Vancouver Island.

The whacky-lib city council in Seattle can feel good about themselves saying they've done this, but in reality they've done nothing to cure a persons addiction, or head off the next one.  In addition, it diverts attention and money from enforcing laws and making the community safer for the law-abiding citizens of Seattle.  <br/><br/>It is a red line that should not be gone over, and I was a state delegate for Bernie Sanders.  We need to aggressively address enforcement and treatment, not enablement.  Saying that what we've tried doesn't work does not legitimize this option.  Stop America.  Grow up.

This epidemic has taken thousands of lives from families, as loved ones have died alone. Our beloved has been addicted to opiates for six years and other drugs for 17 years. A Sober High School, drug rehab and other interventions failed. Then came heroin and a heavy fall from grace. If you witness a loved one pawn everything, on the edge of losing home and job, and life, the reality of death from a drug overdose sends chills down your spine and is a nightmare that is almost impossible to wake up from. I 100% support Safe Injection Sites and am sad to say I support a place where addicts who snort heroin could come and do that safely as well. We are fortunate in that our loved one agreed to a 3 month detox, group counseling and therapy and work skills building program. That intervention worked. But for those who cannot afford the high cost of such treatment, who can really honestly argue that saving a life is not the most compassionate thing to do for someone who has become so ill that they  lost control of their desire to recover.

Parents at conference night will also occasionally mention their promotion of books to their daughters. But, in 18 years of teaching, not once have I heard a boy mention that his parents promote reading to him. I've also never heard a parent say they often buy and discuss books with their son.

This fish alone holds 400 millions years of past knowledge of how the world evolved and looking at it helps us understand just how intricate the history of our world really is. The fact that a single species could survive so long with no change through multiple extinctions shows how life can persist through the worst circumstances. When we think of that past and extinct animals we often think about mammoths, dinosaurs, and these huge creatures and we don’t think about the fish like the Coelacanth that would be overlooked by most people but they, in fact, have survived even longer than dinosaurs and mammoths and contain more information about the past.

When I saw an ad in the NY Times in the 90's about a house rental on the island, I jumped at the chance to get away. I knew it was remote. And I went there for seven years in a row. To relieve the stress of working in Brooklyn Family Court. The article didn't mention there are two sand beaches on the island, Markey and South Sandy. And that the island is two miles long and one mile wide. Mainiacs, as some of the people of Maine like to be called, have a wry sense of humor. And they notice a NY accent right away. My second summer out there, someone remembered our last name and I was a little stunned. \"You remember us\", I asked? And they said, \"Yeah, you're from Noo Yawk and you drink cawfee.\" We used to cook Puerto Rican dishes for some of the people on the island, like codfish salad with hard boiled eggs and avocado slices. Boy, but they sure were appreciative. One lobsterman showed up at our door with a bucket of fresh lobsters. We couldn't eat lobster every day so I snuck out one night and released a few into the harbor. It was Natalie Ames' father who gave us the lobsters. He was one of the friendlest guys.

A school should be a safe place where students can learn and if teachers were armed, students would be in constant fear of their teachers. Police officers are already able to kill people without consequence and teachers should not be added to that list. Another point that Trump brought up was \"a little bit of a bonus\" given to armed teachers. How would teachers get enough money to have proper gun training when they don't even have enough money for school supplies?

Too much thinking makes it harder for people to just accept their miserable lot without complaining about Republicans taking their stuff.  How much better it would be if they told each other Bible stories and suffered their boils and pestilence in silence.<br/><br/>To make his point, Mr. Brooks has to convince us that things were worse back in the 1950s.  But things are relative.  The 1950s were a time of astounding technical and economic advances.  Back then, we valued education.  The G.I. Bill sent millions to college.  Now many kids must go into debt to get a decent education.<br/><br/>We valued science and technology back then.  Now science is denied by our politicians, who run on platforms of bringing back black lung, recriminalizing abortion and promoting creationism in classrooms.  I’m sure the rational atheist Steven Pinker isn't OK with that.<br/><br/>The technology that promised a new age of modernism in the ‘50s has turned on us.  It pollutes our elections.  It invades our privacy, sucks out our personal information and shoves advertising down our throats.  It charges us a fortune for phones, Internet access and cable TV.<br/><br/>We don’t have the problems we had a half-century ago.

My work primarily consisted in counseling the families of teenagers who were in danger of being removed from their homes.  I often conducted sessions in clients' homes and was often faced with situations where I might be alone with a client.  I tried to avoid these situations by insisting that family members be nearby, or choosing to meet in a public place.  Prevention is always the best defense. To that end I hired an independent supervisor with whom I met on a monthly basis to report and discuss any situations that might have come up where I felt I could become the target of false accusations.  That way, at least I had a record of events as well as another professional who could testify that I discussed said events at the time they occurred - much like former FBI director James Comey's use of memoranda to annotate his meetings with President Trump.

America yawned. <br/><br/>When his main antagonist on race, Donald Trump, challenged his right to be an American president, America was almost completely indifferent to the insult. They (63-millions) giddily rewarded the white man the presidency, never seriously vetting his suitability and fitness for the office. So much for the Constitution as a defining tenet of the uniquely American experiment of \"democracy.\" It was always just for show; was never heartfelt and generous as Christ demanded.<br/><br/>Frederick Douglass and his towering intellect were unappreciated by whites, educated or no. What's so different from 1861 to 2018 but time? Trump proved last year that he didn't know who Mr. Douglass was.\n",

He observed that they were every bit as good, as brave and as smart as whites when they fought for him during the Civil War and therefore considered them equal.  <br/><br/>He was a friend of Fredrick Douglas and Douglas knew that no American worked harder to bring blacks to equal citizenship than Grant.   He spent his life trying to achieve this while many abolitionists never came to believe in black equality.  When push came to shove they allowed the white  South to have their way and establish Jim Crow.  <br/><br/>Grant would be outraged that, to this day, black Americans have not achieved economic parity to whites and that America still perpetuates systemic anti-black racism.  \n",

I worked in a community with many new immigrants and newly-built homes since the previous census, one of the few to which no census forms were sent and personal visits were required. This was never publicized and created great confusion. Census workers visited every structure, and had to map any new houses and correct errors in the previous map.  This is a more labor-intensive method, but those communities which have had dramatic changes during the past ten years require this to be anything close to accurate.  I had 100% cooperation from the immigrant community no matter what their living conditions were.  In fact, it was only a non-immigrant man who lived in a prosperous area who threatened me and forced me off his property. This, and  many other homes, were way back in woods and not visible from the street or adjoining property.  Frightening!  What we must fight against is adding any new question to the 2020 form concerning immigrant status.  This would deprive a huge number of towns and major cities from getting anything near an accurate count and therefore deprive them from receiving their just assistance from the Federal Government.

            "I think that we have all used nepotism to our advantage at some point in our lives. Weather it was getting the big promotion or just getting to pick where your group is going to eat we have all gotten something through family connections before. Like Kwame Anthony Appiah said in his column “The world of work is full of unfairness.” and we have to deal with that, it’s all about the situation you are in. People who think that nepotism is O.K. have most likely experienced it and fully appreciate what their family member or close friend did for them. But on the other side there is a type of person that has never gotten special treatment in the workplace and thinks that it is unfair to get ahead by using family. Weather or not we think nepotism is O.K. is if we have used it before. In his writing Kwame Anthony Appiah explains how he thinks that nepotism is morally wrong but how he might have to use it. His stance on nepotism seems to vary on the situation at hand. I personally have never had a job that was related to my family or friends in any way. Both jobs that I have had I came in a complete stranger, so although I have never used it I have also never been beat out or put down because someone else received special treatment. So all in all, I think that my position, and everyone’s position on weather nepotism is O.K. will change based on their work position. If you need a job: nepotism is great, if you just lost a job to your boss’ son nepotism just ruined your life. \n",

If you think about it many young adults right out of high school are eagerly looking for internships that hopefully lead to full time jobs after their done with college.  If they were to receive one based solely based on the fact they their getting the internship because one of their parents worked at that establishment doesn’t mean they should throw the opportunity away.  In the quote from the article below a college student professes his opinion about he feels towards this subject.  “I think that internships should be earned based on merit, and that nepotism is unethical. I am not sure, however, if avoiding nepotism as an applicant would do anything to put a stop to the practice.”  His opinion is a valid one by simply refusing to accept the position and instead find an internship the “right way” nothing is being changed.  The role will be filled by someone else and the cycle will continue and refusing the position will be seen as a missed opportunity.

When it comes to jobs with education, and other reasons then relative incorporation is not that big of a deal. <br/><br/>Secondly, Mr.Appiah stated that you need the system to reform it. If we need and want to change the current business policies you have to do it from being in the job. People need to learn to play the game.

It is the same story as we have seen with Aleppo. Ghouta is a stronghold of Islamic terrorists hoping to establish an Islamic State.<br/>2.) These terrorists have not only threatened to poison the water supply of Damascus that runs through this area, they have already done so in the past. Damascus gets about 20% of its water supply via Ghouta.<br/>3.) The inhabitants of Ghouta have been warned to leave the area via radio and leaflets for the past weeks, they knew the deadline.<br/>4.) Some inhabitants of Ghouta still do their shopping and visit restaurants in neighbouring districts. Ghouta is far from being isolated<br/>5.) When talking to some people from the district, you'ill learn that they use kids as human shields and prevent them from leaving the danger zone. Their \"arguments\" are usually \"Allah will grant these kids martyrdom and that is better than living\". Which is by far the most cynical way to \"argue\" why they put children in harms way and expect, yes, expect them to die for propaganda reasons.<br/>6.)

One said about half the people couldn't come up with $400 &amp; the other that 2/3rds couldn't find $1,000. <br/><br/>There are two reasons for this. One is the federal gov is not sending enough money to the private sector. It does this by deficit spending, but the deficit has fallen 75% since 2009. The other reason is that the money it and the FED HAVE sent is not very useful. Economist would say it has low velocity which means it doesn't change hands in domestic commerce very much. If you look at what has happened to the velocity of money since 2008, you see it has plunged.<br/><br/>Why is this? Because too much of the money is going to the people who do not need it &amp; use it to speculate. If you compare the percent of money going to the 1% with the velocity of money (MZM), you will see the curves are almost precise opposite of one another since at least 1960.<br/><br/>The rise in the stock market is a symptom of this in which more &amp; more money is chasing itself around uselessly. <br/><br/>THUS, while Trumps' polices may send some more money to the private sector, most of it will not be useful.\n",

But then we go out in the real world and are faced with the hard truth that dating is anything but what it seems to be in the movies.<br/> I'm sure the makers of dating apps thought they were doing everyone a favor, but what they seem to be doing according to Madeline Apple, is \"[killing] the college dating scene. Because it’s so easy to swipe left or right on a seemingly endless pile of potential partners, it’s become harder to actually meet anyone.\"<br/>Tinder is an incredibly shallow dating app. You could probably spend hours swiping on \"potential matches\", only those \"matches\" don't lead to many relationships. If you see something you like, you swipe right. It's not like you get to know that person before you decide that they're worth swiping for. I personally think that emotion has been taken out of the equation of dating. A perfect example, from what I've heard from many users of Tinder, is it's not geared towards dating, when someone swipes right, they're not thinking about what your interests are, they're thinking about how they can get you to spend the night.<br/>On another token,on dating websites, people are able to say however they feel.

As one of the articles mentions, \"the same snap asking to 'hang out' sent at 2 p.m. can have a completely different meaning when sent at 2 a.m. <br/><br/>Most online dating apps meant for young people, such as tinder, are tailored for the \"hooking up\" crowds, people who want someone to be with, but not for long. These relationships are very casual. They are great for meeting new people, but most \"tinder relationships\" don't seem to workout. <br/><br/>Technology is a great way to communicate with your boyfriend, girlfriend, or potential love interest that you don't get to see very often. Yes, you do have the occasional missed text, like Kasey Roper mentions, but if you can't see this person every single day, texting, snapchatting, calling, and video calls make up for those lost hours and can bring the two of you closer.\n",

It leeches the true meaning of dating by putting it an algorithm and letting it rip. People are meeting on these sites by the dozen, and quantity is not the same as quality. Rather than opting for a dating site, just meet people and make connections. Sure, not everyone will be relationship material, but at least you are meeting people and probably making friends.<br/>Another problem is that people are less intimidated online which does more harm than good. It means that people are less likely to be honest and more likely to feel comfortable behind the mask of the internet. This is scary because you can speak to someone online and think you know them, then see them in person and doubt this.

But do you want to know what really happened in New York this summer dear reader? I’ll tell you….\n",

            "“The sooner I get to work, the sooner I can go home. The sooner I get to work, the sooner I can  go home.” For now, this is my mantra, the only thing that keeps me going, day after day after day after day. I have to ride the train into the busy, trafficky city, to work in said pollution-filled, treeless city, to earn a living for my family at home. I yearn for my vacations, and while I ride on the train, my mind wanders back toward the trip we took last weekend on the sailboat. It was the first time we took Mira and Bella onto the boat, and they loved it just as much as I always have. They faced the wind that whipped their perfectly braided hair into a mess resembling that of a stray dog on the street, but it was worth the detangling shampoo and wide-toothed comb used that night. Being on the water allows for a feeling of freedom that you can’t find inside the congested, stifling city. We love our small-town home, even if it means an extra 45 minutes added to the daily commute. That being said, I’m doing everything I can to find a job outside of the rigid, corporate workplace in the loud, boisterous city. I would do anything to work close to my home and my family in a place where tranquility abounds and I can hear myself think. “But today is not that day,” I think to myself as I ride silently on to the obnoxious, crowded city. \n",

I would think that the newly resurgent Russian bear to their east would help concentrate their thinking. As for the EU, a member state that fails to live up to its initial commitments should be held at arms length until they do, which means reduced economic support. If Poland and Hungary continue to drift into right-wing, fascist-style governments they should be cut loose before they drag down the viable states in the European Union.

However,  the play cleverly weaves enough wonky policy into drama to engage the audience and make us care.  (A demurral--it is not at all obvious that the characters are Democrats--they actually seem like that endangered species once known as moderate Republicans).  Yes, the play strongly advocates that if one wants change than one must enter into the political arena, notwithstanding its many perils.  But Sydney does fail--a warning to the hundreds of neophytes gearing up for 2018 and 2020: this game ain't for sissies; it may be, in fact, impenetrable.  \n",

I challenge the reviewers to consider how both were deliberate choices meant to detach honest conversations about our political system from how we feel about the participants debating our political system. It reminds me of a similar criticism of Hillary Clinton, someone acutely able to explain how arcane laws impact the lives of individual Americans and the US economy generally and who posses a phenomenal mastery of our political system and it’s linitations, but who was ultimately deemed over exposed, not likable enough and without a redeeming story arch.<br/><br/>KINGS intentionally sacrificed mass market commercial appeal in favor of highlighting the terrifying fact that special interest groups have realized that no one is paying attention to the boring parts of lawmaking— probably because we are all too busy watching Frozen, a NYTimes critics pick. \n",

              "\"<p>It's good to be a firefighter, especially if you live in a small town. You're one of the best-paid guys around. You get lots and lots of time off to go fishing or hunting or run your own business on the side. And your union always gets its way.</p><p>There's just one problem. The people you work for can't afford you anymore.</p><p>'We're spending 25 per cent of our operating budget on firefighters,' Ted Luciani, the mayor of Thorold, Ont., told me the other day. 'It's not sustainable. We've hit the wall.'</p><p>Thorold is a middle-class town of 18,500 in southwestern Ontario. It has 15 significant structure-related fires a year, the mayor's office says. But although its 18 firefighters don't have much to do, they make big-city money. An arbitrator recently awarded them a retroactive 9.2 per cent raise that bumped their pay to $92,119. Similar settlements have been awarded throughout the province. Most of the people who make these towns' Sunshine List (because their compensation is over $100,000) are cops and firefighters.</p><p>Firefighting is increasingly a lucrative part-time job. Starting next year, Thorold's firefighters will switch to 24-hour shifts, which means they'll work approximately seven shifts every 28 days. The advantages of this arrangement are obvious. Mayor Luciani is not happy about this change. He figures that overtime and sick-pay costs will increase. Besides, he fumes, 'We'll be paying them to sleep on the job.'</p><p>Municipalities that resist the union's demands can go to arbitration. But they virtually never win. Arbitrators simply hand the union whatever the last guys got. 'When the municipalities lose 100 to zero, there's something wrong,' the mayor argues. 'The arbitration system has to change.'</p><p>Thanks to better building materials and stiffer fire safety regulations, the number of fires across Canada has plunged. In big cities, only a small number of the calls to the fire service are for actual fires. (In Toronto, only 9.9 per cent of calls to the fire service in 2013 were about fires; in Calgary it was just 3.4 per cent.) But the number of firefighters just keeps going up. Thorold and other municipalities aren't able to cut staffing levels because of manning clauses in the contracts.</p><p>A new report by the Fraser Institute says the number of fires in Ontario fell by 41 per cent between 1997 and 2012, while the number of firefighters increased by 36 per cent. Although precise statistics aren't available for all of Canada, the national trends are the same. On top of that, firefighter compensation has risen faster than inflation, according to the report.</p><p>The firefighters' union does not want to acknowledge any of this. Its strategy is to try to discredit and intimidate its critics, while reminding us that firefighters risk their lives on our behalf. They like to warn that any effort to challenge its demands will put the public at risk of frying in their beds. They insist that firefighters do extremely valuable work when they're not fighting fires, such as training, prevention, public education, inspections, and pre-fire planning, to say nothing of sending their big red trucks screaming through the streets to rescue people in car accidents.</p><p>I have respect for firefighters. They're brave people and they do their jobs well, so far as I know. But their union is far too powerful for the public good. The arbitration system is broken, too. Although arbitrators are supposed to consider a town's ability to pay, in fact they don't. As a result, firefighters and cops are eating up a bigger and bigger piece of municipal budgets, and leaving less and less money for parks and libraries and everything else.</p><p>The firefighters' sense of entitlement is rapidly exhausting the goodwill of the public, who are increasingly fed up at their high salaries and cushy working conditions. 'Yes, they save lives,' Mayor Luciani says. 'But nurses save lives too. And look how hard they work. When nurses go on shift they're working every minute. They save lives every day.'</p><p>Thorold's wrangle with the firefighters is over for now, but not for long. This dispute take years to settle. They'll be back to the bargaining table in January.\\\\</p><p>Clarification: The original newspaper version and an earlier online version of this column estimatedthere were maybe 10 to 15 fires a year in Thorold, Ont. The mayor's office now confirms that there were 15 significant structure-related calls resulting in $960,000 of fire loss in 2014. This online version has been updated.</p><p> </p>\""
